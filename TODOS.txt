TODO:

Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:

	- Add constructors etc to container classes (Probabilities, MapSettings etc.)
	
	- Create higher fidelity noise mask for water and grass tiles
	- Figure out why sprite masks cause editor issues (does build share said framerate issues?)
	
	- Biome constructors are a bit messy once more
	
	- Rosebushes disappearance bug (sprite layers seem OK)
	
	- Enemy spawning in Rosepatch
		- Check enemy behaviour works ok within the island
		
	- Refactor tile lookup to just pick Sprite object
	
	- Go through the leftover FIXMEs
	- Player controller general refactor
	
	//- Add an IDie interface, to avoid that one awkward switch statement
		- Move all non-player world interaction scripts to a World folder (incl. interfaces above), via Unity - VS seems to create oddities
			- Set Tile HeldEnergy value in editor
			- Check if EnemyController is enough to call enemy Die() and GetHeldEnergy() (as die is technically an AnimationManager thing)
				- Test enemy death
				- Assign held energy in editor to enemy as well
		- Remove commented out ProximityScanner energy values

Music change?

Mom does not start dying
	
Make sure there's a fail state etc.
	-Audio when mom is low?

Draw wisp pixel art sprite + spritesheet

Pick-up orb animation (leave branch in existence)

Teleportation back to mum
	- Animation
		- Same as jump up
		- Fade screen to white
		- Need to wait for animation to be done before teleporting
	//- Move to startingPosition by setting transform manually?
		
Ending
	- Play last clip
	- Fade to black
		
Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change
