TODO:

Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:

	- Add constructors etc to container classes (Probabilities, MapSettings etc.)
	
	- Create higher fidelity noise mask for water and grass tiles
	- Figure out why sprite masks cause editor issues (does build share said framerate issues?)
	
	- Biome constructors are a bit messy once more
	
	- Rosebushes disappearance bug (sprite layers seem OK)
	
	- Enemy spawning in Rosepatch
	- Refactor tile lookup to just pick Sprite object
	
	- Go through the leftover FIXME areas
	- Player controller general refactor
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mom does not start dying
	
Make sure there's a fail state etc.
	-Audio when mom is low?

Draw wisp pixel art sprite + spritesheet

Pick-up orb animation (leave branch in existence)

Teleportation back to mum
	- Animation
		- Same as jump up
		- Fade screen to white
		- Need to wait for animation to be done before teleporting
	//- Move to startingPosition by setting transform manually?
		
Ending
	- Play last clip
	- Fade to black
		
Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change

Check enemy behaviour works ok
