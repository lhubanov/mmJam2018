TODO:

Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
	
	//- Create method of spawning prefab from a list of prefabs (runes/bushes/flowers etc.)					
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
		- Flower Field biome
		- Separate Ruins biome
		- Tree distance rules
		- More stuff to spawn in swamp

	- Visualizing tile placement might provide clarity why spawning works from one side to the other
		- As the script is blocking currently, perhaps this is achievable via a secondary thread
	
	- Also, try assigning coast in post-processing around the end maybe? to try solving the cliff/grassland coast issue and the inner-island beach problem
		//- Try swapping with normal grass tile and see how odd it looks (if at all) - to avoid adding marsh tile-related work
		- Add inner passable water marsh tile prefab 
			- Visually - water + bushes, maybe a darker shade bush (maybe procedurally spawn bushes?)
			- Add script interaction to player that reduces speed
			
			Marsh tile info: 			
				- Maybe add a special type of inner-island/marsh water, which can be drained? - investigate implementation - may be able to do via collider triggers enter-exit setting a max speed var
					- Traversable, slowing down player movement speed (?) and so it looks as if model legs descend in the "marsh" sprite - might require some visual trickery
			
	//- Water tile
		//- Add impassable collider to prefab
		
	- Create proper container classes at one point (probabilities and MapSettings need constructors etc.)
				
	//- Remove that Console.WriteLine() thing in Map.SpawnMembers() to see if whatever was happening there still happens
	- Find way to add noise to sprite edges (a-la Amit's island generation)
	
	//- Rework stupid elevation increase formula (might help w/ inner beach issue)
	//- Check elevation assignment function as formula seems to not be the fault
	
	//- Rename Swamp to Rosepatch
	- Expose elevation on a tile-script level - assign post-initialization and make each tile have a base interface, which this is assigned through
	
	- Add new colliders to member prefabs (trees, pillars etc.) and sort their order
	- Make player collider smaller
	
	//- Check generated island can be drained
	
	- Refactor the biome constructors that make a new List() in constructor call instead of done in factory
		- Or split grassland into several different biomes
		
	- There a lot of small refactorings to be done in FIXME comments - go through them
	
	- Flower patch camera bug - some of the flowers disappear, as char walks on them
	- Tree does not drain (need to double-check tree prefab's attached script and what its looking for)

There are a bunch of tag comparisons worth refactoring in Player code

Make sure there's a fail state etc.
