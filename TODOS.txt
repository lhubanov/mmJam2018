TODO:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs and refactoring:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	- Container clases - either make better classes - w/ constructors, properties etc., or rework altogether
	- Biome constructors are a bit messy once more
	
	- Sprite mask framerate issues - seen in build as well
	
	//- Rosebushes flicker bug (sprite layers seem OK)
	
	- Start screen needs a Loading/Loaded event/UI
	
	- Enemy behaviour in-depth testing
		- Raycast always points down, but wandering seems to be fine
		- Collision avoidance works ok for the most part, but could be improved (seem to go through trees sometimes; issue related to tree colliders)
		
	- Refactor tile lookup to just pick Sprite object
	
	- Go through the leftover FIXMEs
	- Go through Proc-Gen code to check if all is needed (e.g. INode might be redundant)
	
	- Player controller general refactor
	- The branch disappearing animation still calls Animator.Play(string) with an editor-set string. There must be a way
	  to assign the playable animation as an object.
	  
	- The screen un-fading needs a proper formula to reset fading amount, when the player recharges mum
	//- Player position does not reset at the end of the game
	
	- FadeAmount overflows and makes things non-black again - add some setter function, which stops it from overflowing
	
	//- Ending/Death fade to black slowly animation
	
	- The audio music switching bugs
		//- Low Health sound
		- End dialogue etc.
