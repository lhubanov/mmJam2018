TODO:

Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
	
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
		- Flower Field biome
		- Separate Ruins biome
		//- Marsh biome
			//- Add special marsh prefab (just of ISlowDownPlayer type or sth, player can then check upon collision enter or sth)
			//	but need to make sure it's not ultra slow
			//- Darker shade fo bush
			//- Make undrainable, alongside water tile (cause it looks weird)
			
			- Ocean tiles spawn in-between marsh tiles
			- WHY ARE THE ROSEBUSHES PARENTING WEIRD AND NOT DESPAWNING ANKLJGHASNLKHKLS
				- Ok, they are all parenting weird actually- the parent tile thing might nto be working
			- Movement slow down scripting
			
		- Tree distance rules
			- Or maybe experiment with reducing tree spawn probability so they are sparse enough
					
	- Create proper container classes at one point (probabilities and MapSettings need constructors etc.)
				
	- Find way to add noise to sprite edges (a-la Amit's island generation)
	
	- Add new colliders to member prefabs (trees, pillars etc.)
	- Sort out sprite layer order incl player interactions
	//- Make player collider smaller
	
	- Refactor the biome constructors that make a new List() in constructor call instead of done in factory
		- Or split grassland into several different biomes
		
	- There a lot of small refactorings to be done in FIXME comments - go through them
	
	//- Flower patch camera bug - some of the flowers disappear, as char walks on them
	- Tree does not drain (need to double-check tree prefab's attached script and what its looking for)

There are a bunch of tag comparisons worth refactoring in Player code

Add Start and end areas, which are not Proc Gen'd

Make sure there's a fail state etc.
