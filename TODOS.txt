Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
					
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
	
	- Visualizing this might provide clarity why spawning works from one side to the other
	
	- Initial issues with GraphGeneration seems to be fixed w/ swapping x/y node traversal order
		- Once quick per click generation is done - try a variety of seeds to see if true
		
	- Also, try assigning coast in post-processing around the end maybe? to try solving the cliff/grassland coast issue
	
	- Expose as many parameters as possible to RegionGenerator, so that generation @ different states can be done
	at the click of e.g. LMB to visualise impact of different parameters
	
	- Find way to add noise to sprite edges (a-la Amit's island generation)
	- 2 Layers of beach?
	
	- Water tile
		//- Start by trying grass tile in blue
		- See if there is need to create a new sprite
		
	- Sand/beach tile
		- Draw new sprite
	
	- Rework stupid elevation increase formula
		
	- Create a bunch new prefabs as spawnable members (picked at random more-or-less)
		- Ruins Biome members (Enemies need to be spawnable here)
			- Column
			- Broken column
			- Rock 1
			- Rock 2
		
		- Grassland
			- Bush 1
			- 2x Bushes
			- Tree (needs some rules, due to potential traversal issues
			- Flower(s)
				- 1x Flower
				- 5x Flowers randomly
				- Farm-like patch of flowers
		
		- Swamp
			- Purple bush
			- 2x Purple bushes
	
		
	- Standardize the usage of the probabilities (either 0-100 ints or 0-1 floats)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
Make sure there's a fail state etc.
	-Audio when mom is low?

Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change
Generify branch animation

Refactor input controller (it does not feel good + code is messy)
