TODO:

Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs and refactoring:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	- Add constructors etc to container classes (Probabilities, MapSettings etc.)
	- Biome constructors are a bit messy once more
	
	- Create higher fidelity noise mask for water and grass tiles
	
	- Sprite mask editor framerate issues 
		-Seems framerate issues are editor-only?
	
	- Rosebushes disappearance bug (sprite layers seem OK)
		
	- Refactor tile lookup to just pick Sprite object
	
	- Go through the leftover FIXMEs
	- Player controller general refactor
	
	//- Add an IDie interface, to avoid that one awkward switch statement
		- Move all non-player world interaction scripts to a World folder (incl. interfaces above), via Unity - VS seems to create oddities
			- Set Tile HeldEnergy value in editor
			- Check if EnemyController is enough to call enemy Die() and GetHeldEnergy() (as die is technically an AnimationManager thing)
				- Test enemy death
				- Assign held energy in editor to enemy as well
		- Remove commented out ProximityScanner energy values
		
	- Mom does not start dying
