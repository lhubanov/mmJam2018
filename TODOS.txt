Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
	
	//- Create method of spawning prefab from a list of prefabs (runes/bushes/flowers etc.)					
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
		- Flower Field biome
		- Separate Ruins biome
		- Tree distance rules
		- More stuff to spawn in swamp

	- Visualizing tile placement might provide clarity why spawning works from one side to the other
		- As the script is blocking currently, perhaps this is achievable via a secondary thread
	
	- Also, try assigning coast in post-processing around the end maybe? to try solving the cliff/grassland coast issue and the inner-island beach problem
		- Try swapping with normal grass tile and see how odd it looks (if at all) - to avoid adding marsh tile-related work
		
		- Sand/beach tile
			- Draw new sprite
			- Maybe make a marsh-esque tile instead? (closer to the grassland green, so proc gen issues can be better concealed)
	
	- Create proper container classes at one point (probabilities and MapSettings need constructors etc.)
				
	- Remove that Console.WriteLine() thing in Map.SpawnMembers() to see if whatever was happening there still happens
	- Find way to add noise to sprite edges (a-la Amit's island generation)
	
	- Water tile
		- Add impassable collider to prefab
		
	- Maybe add a special type of inner-island/marsh water, which can be drained? - investigate implementation - may be able to do via collider triggers enter-exit setting a max speed var
		- Traversable, slowing down player movement speed (?) and so it looks as if model legs descend in the "marsh" sprite - might require some visual trickery
	
	- Rework stupid elevation increase formula (might help w/ inner beach issue)
	- Add new colliders to member prefabs and sort their order

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
Make sure there's a fail state etc.
	-Audio when mom is low?

Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change
Generify branch animation

Refactor input controller (it does not feel good + code is messy)
