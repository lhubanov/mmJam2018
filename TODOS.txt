Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
					
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
	- Visualizing tile placement might provide clarity why spawning works from one side to the other
		- As the script is blocking currently, perhaps this is achievable via a secondary thread
	
	- Also, try assigning coast in post-processing around the end maybe? to try solving the cliff/grassland coast issue and the inner-island beach problem
	
	
	- Create proper container classes at one point (probabilities and MapSettings need constructors etc.)
				
	- Remove that Console.WriteLine() thing in Map.SpawnMembers() to see if whatever was happening there still happens
	- Find way to add noise to sprite edges (a-la Amit's island generation)
	
	- Water tile
		- See if there is need to create a new sprite
		
	- Sand/beach tile
		- Draw new sprite
		- Maybe make a marsh-esque tile? (closer to the grassland green, so proc gen issues can be better concealed)
	
	- Rework stupid elevation increase formula (might help w/ inner beach issue)
		
	- Create a bunch new prefabs as spawnable members (picked at random more-or-less)
		- Ruins Biome members (Enemies need to be spawnable here)
			- Column
			- Broken column
			- Rock 1
			- Rock 2
		
		- Grassland
			- Bush 1
			- 2x Bushes
			- Tree (needs some rules, due to potential traversal issues
			- Flower(s)
				- 1x Flower
				- 5x Flowers randomly
				- Farm-like patch of flowers
		
		- Swamp
			- Purple bush
			- 2x Purple bushes
	
		
	- Standardize the usage of the probabilities (either 0-100 ints or 0-1 floats)
	
	- Create semi-random method of spawning prefab from a list of prefabs (runes/bushes/flowers etc.)
	- Maybe add a special type of inner-island/marsh water, which can be drained?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
Make sure there's a fail state etc.
	-Audio when mom is low?

Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change
Generify branch animation

Refactor input controller (it does not feel good + code is messy)
