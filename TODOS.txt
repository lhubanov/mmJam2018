Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:

	- Add constructors etc to container classes (Probabilities, MapSettings etc.)
	
	- Create higher fidelity noise mask for water and grass tiles
	- Figure out why sprite masks cause editor issues (does build share said framerate issues?)
	
	- Biome constructors are a bit messy once more
	
	- Rosebushes disappear on and off
	
	- Enemy spawning in Rosepatch
	- Refactor tile lookup to just pick Sprite object
	
	- Go through the leftover FIXME areas
	- Player controller general refactor
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//There are a bunch of tag comparisons worth refactoring in Player code

Make sure there's a fail state etc.
