Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
	- Integrate tile text demo to Unity
		//- Change namespaces to get soln build
		- Start from disecting the RegionGenerator.cs
			//- Do call to map creation there w/ external vars
			- Find appropriate noise function (maybe Unity builtin for the time being)
			//- Remove all the calls to System.Random & use noise func instead
			
			- Change all map creation parameters to match game sandbox (Found through testing really)
				- Positions in space
					- Might need to do the Vector2D to Vector3D conversion code
				- Change text generation to spawn sprites
					(see existing sprite instantiating code)
				
				- Perhaps reference to tile that can be spawned can be attached to Biome
					- It can maybe also keep references to members to be spawned (and perhaps pick a random one out of a selection)
					- Consider doing the Vector2 to Vector3 conversion as a part of Biome as well (as a part of the feeding Center as input thing)
					
					
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
	
	- Try BFS, maybe, as well
	
	- Water tile
		- Start by trying grass tile in blue
	- Sand/beach tile
		- Start by trying to re-color the grass tile

Make sure there's a fail state etc.
	-Audio when mom is low?

Draw wisp pixel art sprite + spritesheet
	
Intro
Ending
UI & Tutorials
		
Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change
Generify branch animation
Refactor input controller (it does not feel good + code is messy)


Extra steering ?
	- Path following
	- Leader following
	- Queuing
	- Hiding?
