TODO:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs and refactoring:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	- Container clases - either make better classes - w/ constructors, properties etc., or rework altogether
	- Biome constructors are a bit messy once more
	
	- Sprite mask editor framerate issues 
		-Seems framerate issues are editor-only?
	
	- Rosebushes flicker bug (sprite layers seem OK)
	
	- Start screen needs a Loading/Loaded event/UI
	
	- Enemy behaviour in-depth testing
		- Raycast always points down, but wandering seems to be fine
		- Collision avoidance works ok for the most part, but could be improved (seem to go through trees sometimes; issue related to tree colliders)
		
	- Refactor tile lookup to just pick Sprite object
	
	- Go through the leftover FIXMEs
	- Go through Proc-Gen code to check if all is needed (e.g. INode might be redundant)
	
	- Player controller general refactor
	- The branch disappearing animation still calls Animator.Play(string) with an editor-set string. There must be a way
	  to assign the playable animation as an object.
	
	- ProximityScanner and HeldEnergyManager merge - rename/delete via Unity (as VS causes odd things)
	- Move Menu to UI
		- Rename Menu to StartMenu
	
	- States-wise - Delete One/TwoBrancesDeadState and just leave TreeDeadState
	- Test all the new stuff (that music gets stopped etc.)

Features before announcing GitHub repo:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide		
	- Start Fleeing from player, once having stolen player energy


Enemy spawning in Rosepatch (as part of proc. gen.)
	

Assign StateMachine.MomMaxHealth value in editor
	- Align with slider max/mins also!

!Make sure there's a fail state etc. (na ralta)
	//- Add State/StateBase - PlayLowHealthSound() and PlayEnd()
		//- Which are to be called by Mom, when low health or when dying
		
		//- PlayLowHealthSound() 
			//- Just play the sound/clip?
		//- PlayEnd() 
			//- Play clip/sound
			- Play animation

	!- Mom death rate increase after first time back (that bit of dialogue)? - Or the other way around?
		- Need to add Mom logic (or actually, maybe Player logic?), to advance the state once, after recharging the first time
		!- Increase death rate by a bit?
		!- Music change can then be a part of a general PlayMusic call


Draw wisp pixel art sprite + spritesheet
Create higher fidelity noise mask for water and grass tiles


Teleportation back to mum
	!- Animation
		!- Same as jump up
		!- Fade screen to white
		!- Need to wait for animation to be done before teleporting
	//- Move to startingPosition by setting transform manually?
	
	
!Ending (after last branch state) - Add separate State (or leave it obscure so you find out you can't save mom only by futily recharging over and over ?)
//- Call PlayEnd() from above
//	(!- Play last clip
//	!- Fade to black animation)
		
In-betweeen dialogue, if there are more voice recordings(requires more states)
