Steering:
	- Can Add/Extend
		- Hide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation:
					
	- Might need to add rules (e.g. positions for spawning ruins/ ruin item selection etc.)
	
	//- Try BFS, maybe, as well
	- Add drawing of sprites at earlier stages to visualize differences in graph traversal (and maybe spot issues?)
		- Draw sprites before drawing members
		- Then draw members at every iteration ?
	//- Also traversal seems to go from right to left - see screenshots
		- Completely changes w/ BFS - investigate patterns
		- Try traversing the whole map tiles again instead of only the "island" tiles
		- Try traversing via BFS/DFS instead of iterating over hashSet, to see what changes
	
	
	- Regarding reworking the graph creation - what about adding edges to previous column and previous row cell
	(e.g. at center creation - if [row-1] is valid, add edge between center and center at [row-1][col]; 
	same if [column-1] is valid - add edge between center and center at [row][column-1])
	
	- Expose as many parameters as possible to RegionGenerator, so that generation @ different states can be done
	at the click of e.g. LMB to visualise impact of different parameters
	
	- Find way to add noise to sprite edges (a-la Amit's island generation)
	- 2 Layers of beach?
	
	- Water tile
		//- Start by trying grass tile in blue
		- See if there is need to create a new sprite
		
	- Sand/beach tile
		- Draw new sprite
	
	- Rework stupid elevation increase formula
	
	- Edges on LHS and top seem to be a bit broken (although top side seems to fit)
		
	- Create a bunch new prefabs as spawnable members (picked at random more-or-less)
		- Ruins Biome members (Enemies need to be spawnable here)
			- Column
			- Broken column
			- Rock 1
			- Rock 2
		
		- Grassland
			- Bush 1
			- 2x Bushes
			- Tree (needs some rules, due to potential traversal issues
			- Flower(s)
				- 1x Flower
				- 5x Flowers randomly
				- Farm-like patch of flowers
		
		- Swamp
			- Purple bush
			- 2x Purple bushes
	
		
	- Standardize the usage of the probabilities (either 0-100 ints or 0-1 floats)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
Make sure there's a fail state etc.

Dialogue in-betweeen (requires more states) or just change
Generify branch animation

Refactor input controller (it does not feel good + code is messy)
